# Ginos Italian Restaurant

Ginos Italian restaurant specialize in traditional Italian food. This website is targeted towards people who love traditional Italian food and to people who just enjoy food,social getherings and anyone who wants to spend a night in with a takeaway or a night out with their family or friends. The reason I built this website was I felt a lot of restaurant websites are now too complicated with too much content. I want to make this website clear and easy to use, so that the information that the user looks for can be easily found.
