# Bugs<div id='id-bugs'/>
*  When I deployed my website I discovered there was an issue when testing responsiveness on my Samsung Galaxy A50. 
   * The image below shows the bug before it was fixed. The footer overlaps the header and navigation bar when viewing on mobile devices.
   ![bug](assets/readme-images/bug.png)
* The problem was solved by adding z-index 2 to the header and z-index 1 to the footer. Once the header index number is higher than the footer index the header and navigation bar would overlap the footer as I had intended.
* After my website was deployed, I had a second problem on the about.html page. My website has a fixed header. This was causing issues because the fixed header was preventing input fields from working correctly in the form. I could only use the input fields when I scrolled to the top of the form. But as I scroll down further the input fields fail to work. 
* I tried to solve this with positioning and using z-index but this did not work. With some help from Slack, I fixed this issue by removing the 400px height from my header, and the form now works correctly.

# Unfixed Bugs<div id='id-unfix'/> 
* I encountered one issue while testing the website on iPhone 12 Pro and Apple Ipad. Contact numbers appear in blue text and are underlined in the footer. 
* The error did not appear on any other device I tested on. It also didn't appear on Chrome dev tools when testing on iPhone 12 pro. 
* The image below shows this bug. I was unable to fix this.
  
  ![unfixed-bug](assets/readme-images/unfixed-bug.png)

* Additionally, I ran into a problem when I posted my project on Slack for review. An individual on Slack noticed that the iframe repeated on his desktop and the pin did not appear or was not interactive.
* Afterwards, I looked at it again on a desktop and I tested this on two different desktops, but I did not encounter this issue.
* Since I could not locate the problem, I was unable to fix it.
