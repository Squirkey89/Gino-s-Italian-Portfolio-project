# Bugs<div id='id-bugs'/>
*  When I deployed my website I discovered there was an issue when testing responsiveness on my Samsung Galaxy A50. 
   * The image below shows the bug before it was fixed. The footer overlaps the header and navigation bar when viewing on mobile devices.
   ![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91072896/143229122-dceba326-afec-457b-82ad-b3078935e8d4.png)
* The problem was solved by adding z-index:11; to the header and z-index:1; to the footer. Once the header index number is higher than the footer index the header and navigation bar would overlap the footer as I had intended.

# Unfixed Bugs<div id='id-unfixed'/> 
* When testing the website on iPhone 12 Pro. In the footer, the contact number appears in blue text and is underlined. 
* The error did not appear on any other device I tested on. It also didn't appear on Chrome dev tools when testing on iPhone 12 pro. 
* The image below shows this bug. I was unable to fix this.
