**Features**
------

**Navigation bar** 
 
The navigation bar is located in the center of the screen and is just below the logo at the top of the page. There are three different tabs that the users can           chose from Home, Menu and About. If the user also clicks on the logos above the navbar this will bring them back to the Home page. The navigation bar is fixed on         the website. So the nav bar will follow the user down the page as they scroll down. This makes it easier for the user to navigate through the website without             having to scroll back up to the top of the page everytime.

Bugs
------

When I deployed my website I failed to remember that the header being fixed and the footeer being position relative would be an issue. I found this out when making my website reponsive for mobile devices. I solved the problem by adding a z-index to the header and footer and making the number on the header index higher then the footer so it would over lap as I had intended it too.
  
Unfixed Bugs
------
  
  There are no unfixed bugs
