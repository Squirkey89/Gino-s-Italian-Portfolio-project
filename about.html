        <h3 class="headings">Our story</h3>
        <p class="statement">Gino's Italian restaurant first opened its doors in 1990. 
            It was opened by Gino Zambrotta and he still runs the restaurant today with his family. 
            Gino moved with his family to Ireland in 1990 with the ambition to bring traditional cuisine to the people of Ireland. 
            It was initially located on the south side of the city.  
            In 2005, the business relocated to the city center.
            This is where the popularity of our food grew. Gino offered the people of Cork great-tasting Italian meals. 
            The recipes that were used have been passed down to Gino's grandchildren, who are still working in the family business.</p>
